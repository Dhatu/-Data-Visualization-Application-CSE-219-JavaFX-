HW Code from my CSE 219 CourseWork
(IMPORTANT:HW1 a draft of the entire Application (but still intact to prove progression and it being prior to applications made via HW3-DATAViLiJ by Sudhin Domala (1).pdf.Therefore, it should be DELETED if you want to run the final project)

This is the layout of the "-Data-Visualization-Application-CSE-219-JavaFX-" listed in this branch:

The data will be in the form of 2-D points with (x, y) coordinates. Additionally, these points may also come with some labels. 
In the computational sciences, there are many algorithms that manipulate such labels or move the data around (i.e., the x and y values may change) such are possible options the user can use. The objective is to develop an application that allows the end user to select some given data and such an algorithm to see how these changes are made. The graphical user interface (GUI) of this application will allow the user to see the changes as they happen, dynamically.

The app is called DataViLiJ because it will be based on a visualization framework called ViLiJ (Visualization Library in Java). This library is itself built on top of JavaFX.

HW3-DATAViLiJ by Sudhin Domala (1).pdf: 
A Software Design Description (SDD) document describes how the software system was to be built. It specifies the packages, classes, methods, variables, relationships, and interactions necessary to meet the needs of the final product. This was prior to HW1 draft
and have screenshots of the manually made UML Diagrams made in Netbeans along with the Application files.

HW3UMLDiagrams/Class Diagrams: As mentioned before, these are the UML Diragrams I have made to illustrate the class diagrams and sequence diagrams that are later implemented to finish the Application.
